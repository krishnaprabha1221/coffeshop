            Coffee is a brewed drink prepared from roasted coffee beans, the seeds of berries from certain Coffea
            species. From the coffee fruit, the seeds are separated to produce a stable, raw product: unroasted green
            coffee. The seeds are then roasted, a process which transforms them into a consumable product: roasted
            coffee, which is ground into fine particles that are typically steeped in hot water before being filtered
            out, producing a cup of coffee.
        <p>
            Coffee is darkly colored, bitter, slightly acidic and has a stimulating effect in humans, primarily due to
            its caffeine content.[3] It is one of the most popular drinks in the world and can be prepared and
            presented in a variety of ways (e.g., espresso, French press, caffè latte, or already-brewed canned coffee).
            It is usually served hot, although chilled or iced coffee is common. Sugar, sugar substitutes, milk or cream
            are often used to lessen the bitter taste or enhance the flavor. It may be served with coffee cake or
            another sweet dessert, like doughnuts. A commercial establishment that sells prepared coffee beverages is
            known as a coffee shop .

                    Let’s Talk Coffee Types

                    With the above questions in mind, consider whether you like your coffee hot or cold. It is a matter
                    of
                    preference, really, but there are key differences between the two brews. Hot coffee is significantly
                    more bitter with the best aroma, for instance. Iced coffee is less acidic and offers a greater range
                    of
                    flavors thanks to its versatility.
                </p>

                <p>
                    You are also less likely to burn your tongue in the mornings if you drink iced coffee, but drinking
                    hot
                    coffee means no potential brain freeze.

                </p>
                <p>
                    There are hundreds of pros and cons to both brews, but regardless of your choice, know that you will
                    still get about the same amount of caffeine you need to seize the day.

                    So here is our list of the different types of coffee drinks available today, and the types of coffee
                    flavors we think you should try! We will also go over the types of coffee beans and types of coffee
                    drinks!
